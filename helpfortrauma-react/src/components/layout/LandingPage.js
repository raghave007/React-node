                                            <p >According to the APA, over half the population has experienced trauma. Unfortunately, this is not news to you. As a licensed therapist, you are seeing the effects on your clients every day. They may present with symptoms of dissociation, PTSD, depression, anxiety or a host of other behavioral and psychological issues. The challenge lies in identifying - and treating - the root cause, not just the symptoms. This is where the Accelerated Traumatology Certification based on the Instinctual Trauma Model<span>TM</span> (ITR) method can help.</p>

However, when you have a life-threatening experience or witness another person in such circumstances, your verbal brain can become overwhelmed, and your executive function (the ability to think your way out of the trauma) fails. You can no longer organize your experience in a logical way. The parts of the brain that deals with survival take over. If you cannot fight or flee the situation, you will respond by freezing. This is when the instinctual trauma response occurs.</p>

The resulting symptoms can include flashbacks, nightmares, dissociation, internal voices, depression, severe panic or anxiety, and phobias, intrusive thoughts about the event, avoidance, arousal, or intrusive symptoms. Under treatment with the ITR™ method, these symptoms are greatly reduced or completely disappear, along with the body memories associated with the traumas.</p>

Dissociation can range from getting lost in thought to a more severe detachment from physical and emotional awareness. According to the American Psychiatric Association, dissociation is “a disruption in the usually integrated functions of consciousness, memory, identity, or perception of the environment.” Dissociation is common for people who have experienced ongoing&nbsp; early childhood&nbsp; traumas. It can be treated effectively with therapy the integrates recoding of the dual brain and integration of the stages of the instinctual trauma response.</p>

The method was developed by Dr. Lou Tinnin, psychiatrist and Dr. Linda Gantt, art therapist, after over 30 years of clinical experience with people coping with all kinds of trauma.&nbsp; The ITR™ method recodes traumatic memory from the right brain format to the left brain format, ending or greatly reducing triggers and symptoms.</p>
                                                    <p>The ITR™ method gives traumatic memories order, verbal coding, historical context, and an objective, third person view that protects the person from re-experiencing the trauma and fosters their capacity for empathy for themselves and others. The client feels the event is finally over and in the past. Many clients say that the ITR™ method radically changed their lives, and therapists often say it’s the only trauma treatment they have seen that really works.</p>

                                                            <p>I am more free to be myself, to be real with everything my life has held, and to allow myself to experience a full range of emotions regarding my life. ITR helped me put together various puzzle pieces I’d been looking at in counseling and couldn’t make sense of. Probably the biggest change is that I know it is a very good thing that I am alive and life is beautiful. There is a big change in my perspective.</p>
